# How to Use Basic Filesystem Commands!
When traversing the magical world of files and directories, sometimes you may only have access to your terminal (or perhaps you prefer to feel like you're coding in the 60s).  When doing
so, there are **very** important commands that you should know.

In this fantabulous blogpost, we will be showcasing how to use the following commands:
* `cd`
* `ls`
* `cat`

Commands such as these can, or in some cases must, have a path that must follow after it when typing it into the terminal.  Therefore, there are three possibilities when running the command:
* The command is run with no path following it
* The command is followed by a directory
* The command is followed by a file

Because this blogpost champions thorough scrutiny, we will be showing all three possibilities for the three commands, making a grand total of NINE examples.  Each example will be
provided with a picture of the terminal and a **short** explanation of the output it relates to.

*side note: we will assume that the workspace we will be utiziling has the following files*

# Changing a Directory
Judging by the title, it may be clear what `cd` stands for.  It changes the working directory.  When in your terminal, the program uses your working directory to resolve any relative paths, and the `cd` command
aids in switching this working directory.  To help keep track of the current working directory, it is useful to use the `pwd` command to "Print the Working Directory."  These names all sort
of make sense.
